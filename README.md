# Detect pneumonia in chest X-ray images

The main objective of the project is to develop an intelligent system to detect pneumonia in chest X-ray images. We consider the
following steps:

- Explore the data and define appropriate classes
- Visualize data and employ appropriate preprocessing to X-ray images
- Develop the detection algorithms
  - Using features and classical machine learning techniques
  - Using neural network architectures
- Presentation of results 

The code, to achieve the goals of this project, and the results can be found [Project_code.ipynb](https://github.com/DimitrisReppas/Detect-pneumonia-in-chest-X-ray-images/blob/main/Project_code.ipynb).



## Dataset 

The dataset we use for the project can be found https://www.kaggle.com/paultimothymooney/chest-xray-pneumonia. From its structure, we can distinguish 3 folders (test, valid and train) 

Download the 3 folders and put them into: /path/to/Detect-pneumonia-in-chest-X-ray-images/
